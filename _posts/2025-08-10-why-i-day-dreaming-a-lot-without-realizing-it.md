I want to discuss my tendency toward introversion and intuition, and how these traits influence the way my mind works. Recently, I have discovered that I daydream a lot, and I think this is related to these aspects of my personality.

I have taken personality tests from MBTI websites such as 16personalities.com, paid tests like the Big Five Traits from Jordan Peterson's understandmyself.com, and even a DNA test report. All of these tests, including repeated ones over the years, consistently indicate that I'm an INTJ, which stands for Introvert, Intuition, Thinking, and Judging (with a particular focus on introversion and intuition). This also aligns with specific traits in my genes that suggest I am introverted and have strong intuition, such as 'Introversion', 'Insightfulness', 'Creativity', and 'Trading', which are rated above average, while other traits like 'Imagination' are labeled as Outstanding.

_Disclaimer: While MBTI is very questionable personality test and people sometimes use it to stretched into something like Zodiac. Nevertheless, I think it is good when we try to discuss specific traits using Carl Jung Personality Theory._

Introvert people is someone who dont get their energy from the external factor like Extrovert people (in a very limited definition).  It means that Introvert undervalue the thing outside of themself, which is what makes the introvert has a tendency toward more valuing internal factor of things, which is themself. 

According to Carl Jung, someone with intuition perceives information unconsciously, often through patterns and possibilities that are not readily apparent to the senses or conscious thought. This means having the ability to predict or sense things beyond immediate reality.

In order to describe Introvert Intuition (Ni), we should also describe what is Sensing Extrovert (Se):

```
Ni as a dominant function will lead the user to prioritize observing and taking in information, ultimately leading them to create an impression based off of this information. When making these observations, they won’t use details directly, rather they will try to look past the details themselves to see what the pattern structure is that the details are fitting into. This is one reason why Ni users tend to not remember a bunch of specific details, but rather the patterns that emerge as a result of the presented information. They want to be able to recognize certain markers to help them derive the sequence of events that are about to unfold, based on their internal database of past impressions. Because of this, they will prefer to observe first before taking any kind of action. They will want to forecast how things will play out before making a decision or acting. Because their extraverted function is in service to their dominant Ni, having some kind of structured decision will be secondary to making observations for the sake of collecting information.

Having Se as a lead function typically gives the user the urge to interact with the present current world around them. They are prone to boredom if they are forced to spend long periods of time theorizing or planning with no foreseeable way to act on the plans being made. These types are particularly drawn to act of doing and will have a desire to interact with whatever they are faced with in order to learn about it. When problem solving, Se dominants’ first instinct will be to play with the different options available to them in order to see what each thing does in order to form some kind of solution. These types will want to see how things physically change and will use that feedback to in order to inform their next move. While it’s not always extremely prominent, these types tend toward the mindset of living in the moment.

These functions of personality can be found in everyone else. Everyone can use it or have ability to use it. But for a certain people, it is how their mind usually works, and they more likely to think in their natural function, and not really familiar to use the other sense of their opposite function which in this case is Se.

```
Ni sees a web of information in their head so to speak. And their intuition helps them puzzle all pieces of the web together, narrowing down onto just one conclusion/idea. They live a lot in their heads, mulling over their ideas/conclusions. 

Se takes in information as it comes, day happens to them - Present focused (what is most relevant in that moment) - show someone else an experience - liking lots of stimulation and variety

These two personality functions can be found in everyone. Everyone can use them or has the ability to use them. But for certain people, this is how their mind usually works, they are more likely to think according to their natural function and are not as familiar using the opposite function, which in this case is extroversion and sensing.

I often find myself daydreaming at work, while commuting, and while riding. It is not the same as thinking; thinking is different from daydreaming (although sometimes we mix the two). Daydreaming is like living inside your head and staying there. Sometimes I forget what reality is, which is why, after all this time, I didn't realize I was daydreaming, because I can't see the difference between my inner and outer realities. My mind constantly provides a stream of images and voices that emerge from within, blending with my perception of external reality. 

When I read Carl Jung's theory and people's writings about Ni types, it made me realize why I do what I do, and how unaware I was for confusing my inner reality with the external world. This confusion has limited my perspective on both.

Obviously, daydreaming has its benefits, such as helping me pass the time, brainstorm, and solve problems when combined with thinking. However, it can also be detrimental, as detachment from external reality and underuse of the sensing function can hinder tasks that require intellectual engagement with sensory input, like using my eyes and hands to solve problems. This means I often lack the external data my mind needs to make accurate predictions or find answers.

This also explains why I’m better at recognizing patterns than remembering specific details. I tend to think about which puzzle piece might fit based on its general shape, rather than focusing on the finer details to make a match. My approach is to move from abstract concepts to details, rather than from details to abstraction—more deductive than inductive. This has been a challenge for me.

But this realization is also a blessing. I now understand that I tend to undervalue my external traits, such as sensing and extroversion. Sometimes I don’t pay much attention to my body or to what others think, because I primarily value my inner voice over external opinions. This is also why I often seem indifferent or lack the motivation to share my thoughts and experiences with others.

From this I also understand that why I choose to work as a legal especially a legal corporate which make sense, given my tendency to incline toward internal side of things. I tend to focus on specific areas that I enjoy most, such as connecting ideas and finding patterns like linking concepts in both law and programming. This is why I’m interested in bridging legal work and technology by developing specialized tools for the legal field. Similarly, in football, my favorite position is Defensive Midfielder (CDM), because it involves connecting and supporting different parts of the team, rather than just attacking or defending. 

I also understand why I enjoy long term projects that each smaller task connects to a larger goal, and I appreciate seeing how different projects interrelate. I genuinely enjoy immersing myself in complex problems and staying engaged with them over time.

But here’s the catch: people who are dominant in Ni often face a common problem, their Se function tends to be underdeveloped:

```
Inferior Se is also playing into this type’s desire to look past the immediate details because the sensory in the present moment is being devalued. This also leads to their tendency to hesitate and not want to act immediately. Their lack of being present in the moment hinders their ability to react immediately and causes them to struggle with improvising. Things not going according to how they foresaw will very likely lead to them being disoriented and unsure of how to proceed. Inferior Se being exercised may lead these types to overindulge in some form of physical pleasure, like food, if not being properly regulated. In a more positive light, it will give these types a desire to travel or otherwise explore the sensory world around them. However, they will want to do so in a planned out and regulated manner as to not get overwhelmed.

This means that if I can use my sensory function more, it will enhance my intuition, because the data gathered from sensory experiences will complement what my intuition produces. By integrating external information with my inner reality, my intuition can function more fully.

Jung suggests that each person's task is to learn the other side of themselves or in this case my opposite function which is sensing and to be more extroverted, to balance out my natural function and develop what is lacking inside of me.

By coming to this realization, I understand my natural strengths and how I can develop them further. I should strive to truly observe what I see, listen to what I hear, and perceive things as they are. 

This new perspective will strengthen the dominant function of myself and enrich my internal world with vivid mental images formed during daydreaming. For example, Kim Jung Gi, a Korean artist, spent his childhood observing and drawing extensively, which allowed him to create entire artworks from memory alone. He is an excellent example of someone with dominant Ni who has also mastered his Se function.
