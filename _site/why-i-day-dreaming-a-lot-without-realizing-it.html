  <h1>Why I Day Dreaming A Lot Without Realizing It</h1>

  <h1 id="why-i-daydreaming-a-lot-without-realizing-it">Why I Daydreaming A Lot Without Realizing It.</h1>

<p>Date: 9 August 2025</p>

<p>Yes, the title is so long. But I want to talk regarding my tendency to have a personality toward Introvert and Intuition, because recently I have been discovered myself, that I have daydreams a lot, and I think this is related to the these function of my personality.</p>

<p>I have tested my personality from MBTI website such as 16personalities.com and paid personality test like Big Five of Traits from Jordan Peterson personality test website on understandmyself.com, also my DNA Test report. All of these tests and some repeated test that I took year after year, consistently tell that I’m an INTJ, which stands for Introvert, Intuition, Thinking, and Judging (Well sort of focused on Introvert and lend toward Intuition capability). This also aligned that I have specific trait in my genes that will make me become an Introvert and having intuition capability like ‘Introversion’, ‘Insighfulness’, ‘Creativity’, and  ‘Trading’ traits that says above average while other traits such as ‘Imagination’ labelled as Outstanding.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: While MBTI is very questionable personality test and people sometimes use it to strecthed into something like Zodiac. Nevertheless, I think it is good when we try to discuss specific traits using Carl Jung Personality Theory.</em></p>

<p>Introvert people is someone who dont get their energy from the external factor like Extrovert people (in a very limited definition).  It means that Introvert undervalue the thing outside of themself, which is what makes the introvert has a tendency and inclined toward more valuing to the internal factor of things which is themself.</p>

<p>While someone who has Intuition, Carl Jung defines the function as someone who perceives information unconsciously, often through patterns and possibilities that are not readily apparent to the senses or conscious thought. It means the ability to predict something.</p>

<p>In order to describe Introvert Intuition (Ni), we should also describe what is Sensing Extrovert (Se):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ni as a dominant function will lead the user to prioritize observing and taking in information, ultimately leading them to create an impression based off of this information. When making these observations, they won’t use details directly, rather they will try to look past the details themselves to see what the pattern structure is that the details are fitting into. This is one reason why Ni users tend to not remember a bunch of specific details, but rather the patterns that emerge as a result of the presented information. They want to be able to recognize certain markers to help them derive the sequence of events that are about to unfold, based on their internal database of past impressions. Because of this, they will prefer to observe first before taking any kind of action. They will want to forecast how things will play out before making a decision or acting. Because their extraverted function is in service to their dominant Ni, having some kind of structured decision will be secondary to making observations for the sake of collecting information.

Having Se as a lead function typically gives the user the urge to interact with the present current world around them. They are prone to boredom if they are forced to spend long periods of time theorizing or planning with no foreseeable way to act on the plans being made. These types are particularly drawn to act of doing and will have a desire to interact with whatever they are faced with in order to learn about it. When problem solving, Se dominants’ first instinct will be to play with the different options available to them in order to see what each thing does in order to form some kind of solution. These types will want to see how things physically change and will use that feedback to in order to inform their next move. While it’s not always extremely prominent, these types tend toward the mindset of living in the moment.

<p>This 2 function of personality can be found in everyone else. Everyone can use it or have ability to use it. But for a certain people, it is how their mind usually works, and they more likely to think like their natural function, and not really familiar to use the other sense of their opposite function which in this case is Extrovert and Sensing.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ni sees a web of information in their head so to speak. And their intuition helps them puzzle all pieces of the web together, narrowing down onto just one conclusion/idea. They live a lot in their heads, mulling over their ideas/conclusions. 

Se takes in information as it comes, day happens to them - Present focused (what is most relevant in that moment) - show someone else an experience - liking lots of stimulation and variety

<p>Jung said that daydreaming is natural activity of Ni People, which is very logical in that sense of their description. Daydreaming is a detachment of the consciousness, means that their mind like to wandering itself while doing something (sort of multitasking).</p>

<p>I do often daydreaming a lot during at work, in commuter, and while I’m riding. It is not thinking per say, thinking is different from daydreaming (sometimes we can mix that with thinking too), daydreaming… well you know is like living inside of your head and stay on that. Sometimes I forget what is the reality, this is also why after all this time, I dont think myself daydreaming, while the truth is I can’t see the difference between 2 realities. The mind speaks to me either give me some kind of imaginations like images or words, voices that emerge from within my mind. I do developed some kind of characters inside of my head, which later I called him “Mr. Check” to help me to tackle some internal or external issues.</p>

<p>When I read Carl Jung theory and people writing around his theory regarding Ni People, it sort of making me realize why I do what I do, and how stupidly I’m, for not aware that I have mistaken to think that my inner reality are also external reality. This mistake disabled my point of view to the both world.</p>

<p>Obviously It has some benefit too, of course, like skipping time, brainstroming, solving something (when combine it with thinking), but it will be bad because of detachment from the external reality itself and not using the Sensing function can be really bad when we are on something that require more intellectual capacity using Sensory organ like the eyes and hand that affecting on how we solve the problem. It Means that i lack the external data to use for my mind to predict what is the answers.</p>

<p>This is also explain why I’m good at pattern matching rather than remembering the detail of things.  I’m thinking something like which piece of puzzle in general that will be fit using such a shape, rather than focus on detail of the shape like using the puzzle side to match it. Sort of from abstract then to detail, rather than detail to abstract, or deductive vs inductive. This is the problem that I had.</p>

<p>But realizing this also comes with blessing. Like now I know, that I undervalue the external factor of myself, which is Sensing and Extrovert function. That sometimes i dont really care about my body and what other think. This is because I only appreciate what is my inner voice says not other people. This is also why I act so indifferent, or lack of purpose to tell about my findings or internal side of me to other people.</p>

<p>From this I also understand that why I choose to work as a legal especially a legal corporate which make sense, given my tendency to incline toward internal side of things. And why i will be focus on certain particular thing that i enjoy the most which connecting the dots within the dots and then like connecting on how legal work is almost the same as programming. The results is that i want to make a connection between legal and programming that can be applied at a certain level in a limited functionality and narrowed it down to specific thing like developing tools for legal. And this also explain why when it come to football, my favorite position is a Defensive Midfielder (CDM) rather than a striker or purely defender.</p>

<p>I also understand why i really like long project, that each smaller project is connected to the larger project and make it other project connected. I really like to stay on the problems.</p>

<p>But here is a catch, for people who dominant on Ni function which is their Se, they have a common problem:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Inferior Se is also playing into this type’s desire to look past the immediate details because the sensory in the present moment is being devalued. This also leads to their tendency to hesitate and not want to act immediately. Their lack of being present in the moment hinders their ability to react immediately and causes them to struggle with improvising. Things not going according to how they foresaw will very likely lead to them being disoriented and unsure of how to proceed. Inferior Se being exercised may lead these types to overindulge in some form of physical pleasure, like food, if not being properly regulated. In a more positive light, it will give these types a desire to travel or otherwise explore the sensory world around them. However, they will want to do so in a planned out and regulated manner as to not get overwhelmed.

<p>This means if I can slightly use more Sensory function, will make my Intuition function fully functioning because of the data that comes from Sensory function, that makes complete what is produce from my Intution using my inner reality to interact with external information.</p>

<p>By realizing this, now I know what need to be solved, which aligned on what Jung suggest that each person task is to learn the other side of themself or in this case my opposite function which is Sensing and to be more Extrovert, to balance out my our natural function and develop what is lack inside of me.</p>

<p>Also by realizing this, now I know what is truly my natural function that I can improve. For example my imagination is good, then by increasing the observing something  will lead to the betterness of my function even more, to make rich my internal world using mental image that i built during daydreaming. For example the Kim Jung Gi a korean artist, used to observe and draw a lot during his childhood, that can benefit him to draw the entire picture only using his mental image. I think He is the best example of someone who has a dominant Ni that also master his Se function.</p>

<p>Jung said that a truly functioning Ni people can act like what ‘Shaman’ position in tribes. Shaman predict the future and possess a healing factor to their tribe. This position can only be happen if Ni started to share their inner finding to the world.</p>

<p>I should truly see what I see, hear what I hear, and perceive something as they are. In order to be complete.</p>
